      "body": "These are some thoughts when trying to implement a MPEG-DASH streaming backend on Rust.\r\n  \r\nI found out that a lot of media related libraries such as the almighty [`FFmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org/), are GPL or LGPL. This sort of sets the landscape for other media-related projects to be GPL, since it eases linking to `FFmpeg` without delegating to spawning an external process to intereface with it, and also asking users to install `FFmpeg` separately.\r\n  \r\nHowever if you have to link to `FFmpeg` for whatever reason, there is an option to link it as LGPL (basically it is about building `FFmpeg` minus its GPL dependencies) and keep your current license. As it goes for most copyleft projects, there are other non-technical requirements like provisioning a way to distribute `FFmpeg` source etc. They have a good checklist on how to comply on their legal page ([here](https://ffmpeg.org/legal.html)).\r\n  \r\nMeanwhile, I would like to keep my projects on the more open MIT/BSD licenses, and also viably sustainable to use by me and also implementors, so naturally I want to avoid dependencies with copyleft licenses. The good thing is that I do not need an all-in-one library, so that makes it a little easier to find for existing implementations. Smaller scoped, single purpose libraries tends to have a more open license. Excellent libraries such as [`mp4-rust`](https://github.com/alfg/mp4-rust), and [`rust-id3`](https://github.com/polyfloyd/rust-id3) exists in non-copyleft licenses. I hope there is a trend for these single purpose libraries to keep being non-copyleft licenses.\r\n  \r\nOn a sidenote, I use [`cargo-deny`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny) with the following `deny.toml` file and add `cargo deny check license` on CI to make sure that I don't accidentally infect myself with copyleft dependencies.\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[licenses]\r\nunlicensed = \"deny\"\r\nallow-osi-fsf-free = \"both\"\r\n# We want to deny GPL-like crates\r\ncopyleft = \"deny\"\r\ndefault = \"deny\"\r\nallow = [\r\n    # Approved: used in ring\r\n    \"OpenSSL\",\r\n    # Approved: used in unicode-ident\r\n    \"Unicode-DFS-2016\",\r\n]\r\n\r\n# See https://github.com/briansmith/ring/blob/main/LICENSE for clarification.\r\n# ring LICENSE file is more on exlpaining all licenses used, but crate itself is mostly ISC-like.\r\n[[licenses.clarify]]\r\nname = \"ring\"\r\nexpression = \"MIT AND ISC AND OpenSSL\"\r\nlicense-files = [\r\n    { path = \"LICENSE\", hash = 0xbd0eed23 }\r\n]\r\n```",

Some workarounds would be installing older versions of the cask, or fight the errors one by one.\r\n\r\nThe case for `ffmpeg` (version 6.0 atm) is that its dependencies are not pegged to specific versions, so brew will try to install the latest versions for it. My way to resolve it is to force `brew` to use `llvm@15` and use that to install `ffmpeg`. The instructions are as follows:\r\n\r\n  * `brew install llvm@15`\r\n  * `brew link llvm@15`\r\n  * `sudo ln -s  /usr/local/opt/llvm@15 /usr/local/opt/llvm`\r\n  * `brew install harfbuzz --cc=llvm_clang`\r\n  * `brew install ffmpeg`",
